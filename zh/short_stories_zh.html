    <p>晉明帝數歲，坐元帝膝上。有人從長安來，元帝問洛下消息，潸然流涕。明帝問何以致泣？具以東渡意告之。因問明帝：「汝意謂長安何如日遠？」答曰：「日遠。不聞人從日邊來，居然可知。」
    元帝異之。明日集群臣宴會，告以此意，更重問之。乃答曰：「日近。」元帝失色，曰：「爾何故異昨日之言邪？」答曰：「舉目見日，不見長安。」 – 《世說新語 · 夙惠》</p>

    <p>When Emperor Ming of Jin was only a few years old, he once sat on his father Emperor Yuan's knee. A person just happened to arrive from Chang'an, 
    and Emperor Yuan asked about the news from Luoyang, shedding tears in sorrow. Emperor Ming asked the reason for his weeping, and Emperor Yuan explained 
    his intentions for crossing to the east side of the Yangtze. Emperor Yuan then asked Emperor Ming, "In your opinion, comparing Chang'an and the Sun, 
    which is farther away?" Emperor Ming replied, "The sun is farther. I have not heard of anyone coming from the sun. Thus, it's clear the Sun is farther." 
    Emperor Yuan was amazed by the reply. <br><br> The next day, during a banquet with his ministers, Emperor Yuan shared Emperor Ming's thoughts with the rest 
    and asked him again. This time, though, the response was, "The Sun is nearer." Emperor Yuan was stunned, and asked, "Why is your answer different 
    from what you said yesterday?" Emperor Ming replied, "That is because, with lifted gaze, I see the sun, but not Chang'an."

    <p>Wang Gong submitted a memorial stating Wang Guobao's crimes, raising troops to punish him…..Wang Guobao was terrified, and did not know what to do. Wang Xun said: 
    "Wang Gong and Yin Zhongkan have no deep enmity with you; the competition between you is merely over power and status." Guo Bao replied: "Are they going to 'Cao Shuang'
    me?" Xun said: "What are you talking about! You don't have the severe crimes of Cao Shuang, and Wang Xiaobo is not someone like Emperor Xuan!"– Zizi Tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance), Vol 109</p>

    <p>When Huan Wen went on a northern campaign and passed through Jincheng, he saw that the willows he had planted earlier during his posting in Langya had all grown 
    to a circumference of ten spans. Deeply moved, he exclaimed: "If mere trees have changed like this, how can a man endure?" Stroking the branches, he wept with tears 
    streaming down his face. – Shishuo Xinyu (A New Account of the Tales of the World), Yanyu (Speech and Conversation)</p>

    <p>王子猷居山陰，夜大雪，眠覺，開室，命酌酒。……忽憶戴安道，時戴在剡，即便夜乘小船就之。經宿方至，造門不前而返。人問其故，王曰：「吾本乘興而行，興盡而返，何必見戴？」– 《世說新語·任誕》</p><br>
    <p>Wang Ziyou Huizhi lived in Shanyin. One night, heavy snow fell. When he woke up, he opened his windows and ordered to have some liquor. … Suddenly, he thought of 
    his friend Dai Andao, who was then in Shan. Without hesitation, he boarded a small boat at night to visit him. After travelling all night, he arrived at Dai's 
    residence but did not enter. Instead, he turned back. When someone asked, Wang replied, "I embarked on this journey purely on a momentary whim, and when my whim 
    passed, I returned; why should I insist on meeting Dai?"– Shishuo Xinyu (A New Account of the Tales of the World), Rendan (The Free and Unrestrained)</p>

    <p>鍾毓、鍾會少有令譽。年十三，魏文帝聞之，語其父鍾繇曰：「可令二子來。」於是敕見。毓面有汗，帝曰：「卿面何以汗？」毓對曰：「戰戰惶惶，汗出如漿。」復問會：「卿何以不汗？」對曰：「戰戰慄慄，汗不敢出。」–《世說新語·言語》</p><br>
    <p>Zhong Yu and Zhong Hui were renowned for their intelligence and virtuous reputations from a young age. At thirteen, Emperor Wen of Wei heard of them and said to their father, Zhong Yao, 
    "Let your two sons come." Thus, he summoned them for an audience. <br> <br> When Zhong Yu appeared before the emperor, his face was covered with sweat. The emperor asked, "Why is your face sweating?" 
    Zhong Yu replied, "Trembling with fear and reverence, my sweat flows like a stream." The emperor then asked Zhong Hui, "Why are you not sweating?" Zhong Hui replied, 
    "Trembling with fear and reverence, the sweat dare not come out." – Shishuo Xinyu (A New Account of the Tales of the World), Yanyu (Speech and Conversation)</p>

    <p>Yang Fu, after being transferred to the position of Minister of the Lesser Treasury (one of the Nine Ministers), submitted a memorial proposing the reduction of palace women, 
      particularly those who had long fallen out of imperial favour. He then summoned a clerk from the Imperial Wardrobe to inquire about the number of women in the 
      harem. The clerk abided by the rules of the past, and responded: "The palace secrets cannot be revealed." [Yang] Fu became enraged, had the official flogged 
      with one hundred strokes, and berated: "The state's affairs aren't entrusted to the Nine Ministers, but instead to a petty clerk like you?" – Records of the Three Kingdoms, Biography of Yang Fu</p>

    <p>良年五歲而太祖疾困，遺令語太子曰：「此兒三歲亡母，五歲失父，以累汝也。」 太子由是親待，隆於諸弟。良年小，常呼文帝為阿翁，帝謂良曰：「我，汝兄耳。」 文帝又愍其如是，每為流涕。– 《三國志·趙王幹傳》注</p><br>
    <p>When [Cao] Liang was five years old, Cao Cao fell gravely ill. In his final instructions, he said to the Crown Prince (Emperor Wen): "This child lost his mother at 
      three and his father at five — I now burden you with him." From then on, the Crown Prince treated Liang with great affection, more so than his other brothers. 
      As Liang was still young, he would often call Emperor Wen "father," and the emperor would always correct him, saying:  "I am your elder brother." Emperor Wen, touched 
      by Liang's words, would weep for him time and again. – Records of the Three Kingdoms, annotations to Biography of Gan, Prince of Zhao </p>
