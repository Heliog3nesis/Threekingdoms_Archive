      <h2>About: Maps</h2>
      <p>
        The Historical Atlas of China (中國歷史地圖集)<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is a multi-volume work compiled by Tan Qixiang in the 1980s. 
        While <u><a href="https://history-map.osgeo.cn/#/" target="_blank">some websites</a></u> have scanned sections of the atlas and superimposed them over modern basemaps, 
        I'm not aware of any effort to translate and digitize it into a structured, topography-integrated database. This project aims to fill that gap.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Below is a short Q&A outlining the key stylistic choices and conventions I've adopted in this project.

      Tan Qixiang's Historical Atlas of China is the most authoritative atlas of Chinese history and remains a standard reference for historical geography.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> 
      
      <br><br>Like all historical cartography, however, it inevitably involved a degree of approximation and educated guesswork. 
      Compiled in the 1980s, before comprehensive data and easy access were available, some errors and uncertainties were unavoidable. While the maps cannot 
      be considered 100% accurate, they remain among the best available estimates of where places were located and what their surroundings looked like.

      These maps reflect the administrative geography of the 260s, whereas games and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms often focus on the 
      earlier part of the era. By the 260s, many counties and towns had been merged, abolished, or renamed, and certain landmarks or military outposts had 
      fallen out of use or no longer held any significance. 
      <br><br>In addition, some locations featured in stories or games are fictional, or have been conflated with later place names, and are therefore not represented on these maps.

      This project georeferences Tan's maps with modern towns and cities that also appear in the original atlas, using them as anchor points for alignment. 
      Topography from HydroSHEDS<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> has been incorporated to provide elevation context. 
      
      <br><br>In some cases, rivers in the original atlas do not align with valleys in the modern topography. Where possible, they have been adjusted to follow the nearest valley trajectory; 
      where no clear correspondence exists, they are left as originally drawn. These adjustments are not foolproof — river courses may have shifted considerably 
      since antiquity, especially in flatter regions. Even so, the integration of elevation data should provide a closer approximation of the geography.

      In most cases, the standard modern Hanyu Pinyin system is used. For more obscure or ambiguous names, I've traced the root meaning of the characters and 
      matched them with the most appropriate modern Pinyin pronunciation. 
      <br><br>A particular example is Jianwei/Qianwei. Today, the town is known as Qianwei (犍爲), and indeed the first character is usually given only the 
      Qian- pronunciation. However, when looking at the records and artefacts, this is not always the case: in Han times, the commandery was only referred 
      to as Jianwei (楗為), with a wood (木) radical rather than a cow (牛) radical.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>
      <sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> At some point after the Han, the character and its pronunciation somehow shifted. 
      In the maps, both pronunciations are included for accessibility, since it is unclear whether the change had already occurred 
      by the Three Kingdoms period.
      <br><br>Inevitably, a few cases may have been missed or interpreted differently — if you notice any errors or would like to discuss particular names, please feel free to reach out!

      <span>What qualifies as a canal, and what does not?</span>
      <svg class="chev" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"/></svg>
    </summary>
    <div class="qna__a">
      Generally, waterways with the character 渠 (<i>qu</i>, "canal") in their names can be identified as canals, since these were deliberately constructed or 
      engineered channels. In flatter, agriculturally intensive regions — especially downstream of the Yellow River — the distinction becomes less clear. 
      Channels were often excavated, altered, redirected, or reinforced to serve irrigation and transport purposes, effectively functioning as canals even if not 
      entirely man-made. 
      
      <br><br> For this project, I've included only the major canal-rivers. I didn't explicitly marked their many tributaries and connecting 
      channels as canals, though I recognize that they were most likely part of the broader network.
